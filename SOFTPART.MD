# Software Part

So you just assembled device?

What about assembling a project?
In this "Chapter" 
I will tell you how to upload existing Firmware

## Easy way

First of all we need zip file from releases

We will find there 

- bin files (Firmware itself)
- esptool
- script (bat or sh)

Unpack it and launch script

Don't forget `chmod +x FLASH.sh` for linux users

If you'll open script it should automatically flash device.

Don't worry. There is no malware.  

If you don't believe me you can do it by not-so-easy way

This is a fun personal hardware project I started out of boredom...

The project is a **real-world, functional cellular phone** based on a fictional design from a certain visual novel series. It’s built on an ESP32 microcontroller using the [LILYGO T4 board](https://lilygo.cc/products/t4).



## Why I Made This

In July 2024, I was messing around with resource files from some visual novels and stumbled upon the UI assets for a certain mad scientist’s phone. Naturally, my first thought was:

> "What if someone built the real thing?"

I searched GitHub for “Okabe Phone,” “Rintarou Phone,” “Steins Gate Phone”… and found *nothing*. So, I decided to be that someone.

I first posted a photo of the prototype in the Science Adventure Discord server in the [#showcase channel on 09/08/2024, 19:04 UTC](https://discord.com/channels/213420119034953729/453675152287203368/1271529614946074755), and made this repo public on 26/01/2025.

# Okabe Phone

Okabe phone is my project that I was making just because I was bored...lmao.

The project itself is recreation of phone of character from [vn game "Steins;Gate"](https://steins-gate.fandom.com/wiki/Steins;Gate_(visual_novel)) - [Rintarou Okabe](https://steins-gate.fandom.com/wiki/Rintaro_Okabe)


## A little bit of history 


I started this project in July 2024 when I was playing around with unpacking resources of games... When I unpacked Steins;Gate I saw resources of phone and thought to myself.

> Imagine if someone recreates the actuall device from game it would be so cool...

I quick searched in GitHub "Okabe Phone", "Rintarou Phone", "Steins Gate Phone". And there was no result whatsoever.

So then I decided that I could do that, but I didn't really announce that anywhere ( With exception.I actually sent image of phone in [Science Adventure Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/YBmZzfA) first time in [#showcase at 09/08/2024, 19:04 UTC](https://discord.com/channels/213420119034953729/453675152287203368/1271529614946074755) )

26/01/2025 I decided to make repository public.

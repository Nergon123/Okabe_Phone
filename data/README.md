in this directory will be data to write into spiffs.
If you don't have sd card for example you can copy theme here.

theme needs to be named "MAIN.nph" by default.

theme needs to be compiled with [theme builder](https://github.com/Nergon123/PhoneResourceBuilder).

Precompiled theme for all characters from game will be at some place eventually.

You can get them from [developer](../README.md#Contact) if you built phone by yourself ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°).

---
To send theme into phone you can go to

PlatformIO project tasks -> Platform -> Build Filesystem Image and Upload Filesystem Image
